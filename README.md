The Truth Is Out There: A Compelling Argument for N>1 in the [Drake Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation).

## Overview

This project uses javascript to pull data from a JSON of UFO sightings and presents the data in a summary table.  There are two levels for this project:

|Level|Description|
|---|---|
|Level 1|Filter the data using date only|
|Level 2|Filter the data based on date, city, state, country, and shape|

Filters can be applied by entering text into the input fields and hitting the "Refresh Table" button.  For shapes, there is a drop-down menu of options for shapes.  "Any Shape" will remove filters based on shape, selecting a single shape from the drop-down menu allows filtering for that shape.
